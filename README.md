## Overview
In this project, I wanted to look into how the locations of parks are related and correlated to household income in San Diego. I computed buffers and enriched my data utilizing a service called ArcGIS Online, and I was then able to gather economic data on the areas inside the buffers. I had to find what the cryptic column names meant and cleaned my data otherwise. My data overall was very clean. I conducted my analysis by comparing the observed household high income distribution to the distribution generated by the national average household high income statistics. I then performed this same analysis for moderate and low income households. In the end, my analysis supports the idea that San Diego gardens are placed disproportionately close to high income households, proportionate to moderate income households, and disproportionately far from low income households.

## Research Question
Are San Diego garden locations fair relative to household income? In San Diego, are there gardens nearer communities with high income? What quantifies high income and how does this relate to the proportion of households who have high income around a San Diego garden? Moderate Income? Low Income?
